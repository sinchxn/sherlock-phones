Summary:

The extracted data from Island's Motorola Edge 30 running Android 14 reveals a wealth of information about the user's activities and communications. The device was last logged into approximately 2 days, 21 hours ago. The analysis of calls, SMS messages, WiFi networks, files, and hidden files indicates several noteworthy findings, potentially requiring further investigation.

Key Findings and Insights:

1. Frequent Communication with Specific Numbers:

The call logs indicate frequent communication with the following numbers (sorted by call count, including missed calls):

    +919880394021 (High call volume - Incoming/Outgoing/Missed. Requires content analysis of messages to this number.)

    +919902133722 (High call volume - Incoming/Outgoing/Missed/Unknown. Requires content analysis of messages to this number.)

    +917259340326 (Moderate call volume - Incoming/Outgoing/Missed/Unknown.)

    +17748490654 (Moderate call volume, primarily from early 2024 onwards. Predominantly US number format. This change in call frequency and region is noteworthy.)

    +17813368085 (Moderate call volume, with associated text messages suggesting personal communication, rides, and social events.)

    +917676533497 (Moderate call volume - Incoming/Outgoing/Missed/Unknown. Potentially spam/marketing due to unknown call types.)

    +918277703904 (Moderate call volume - Incoming/Missed/Outgoing. Further investigation required.)

    +919448995125 (Moderate call volume primarily in mid-2023 with very long durations.)

    +16179523432 (Moderate call volume - Incoming/Outgoing/Missed.)

    Others with fewer occurrences.

2. Potential Spam/Marketing Activity:

Several numbers have a significant number of "UNKNOWN" call types and very short durations. This could point to potential spam or marketing calls. Examples include +917676533497, +917602628549. The SMS messages also corroborate this finding, showing multiple marketing messages from shortcodes and services like MyProtein, Walmart, and banking alerts.

3. Geographical Movement/Travel:

The call logs initially show predominantly Indian (+91) number formats. However, from late 2023 onwards, there's a significant increase in US (+1) number formats, suggesting potential travel or relocation to the US. The WiFi network list supports this hypothesis, with SSIDs like "#HIAQatar," "Airport-Frankfurt," "BOSwifi," and "YaleGuest" indicating international travel. The transition appears to occur around the fall of 2023.

4. Financial Transactions and Shopping:

Numerous SMS messages relate to financial transactions (Bank of America, Discover Card) and shopping (Walmart, Amazon, MyProtein). This requires closer scrutiny to identify potential fraudulent activities or unusual spending patterns. The sheer volume of transaction messages could also indicate excessive online shopping.

5. Deleted Data and Hidden Files:

The hidden files reveal .nomedia files in several directories, including Telegram, Pinterest, and the device's root Android/data and Android/obb directories. These files are used to prevent media scanning and may indicate the user's intent to hide specific media or data. The presence of a .nomedia file in the Telegram Stories directory is particularly interesting. Further, deleted photos and a significant number of downloaded APKs and other files moved to trash should be recovered and analyzed for potentially relevant evidence.

6. Apps of Interest:

Based on the files and SMS messages, the user appears to utilize several apps including:

    Messaging: Telegram, WhatsApp, Snapchat

    Shopping: Walmart, Amazon, Temu, MyProtein

    Finance: Bank of America, Discover Card, PayPal, Paytm

    Transportation: Ola, Uber, Lyft

    Food Delivery: Swiggy, Zomato, Doordash

    Productivity: TickTick

7. Noteworthy Activity Timeline:

    Mid-2023: Predominantly India-based activity. Frequent communication with Indian numbers, use of Indian apps and services.

    Late 2023: Possible travel, as indicated by international airport Wi-Fi connections. Shift in communication patterns begins, including more US numbers.

    Early to Mid-2024: Apparent relocation to the US, supported by US-based phone numbers, area codes, and location-based SMS messages (e.g., Dunkin' Donuts, AMC theaters).

    Late 2024 - Present: Continued US-based activity.

Further Investigation:

    Recover and analyze deleted photos and files, especially APK files.

    Analyze content of communication with frequently contacted numbers, particularly +919880394021 and +919902133722.

    Investigate financial transactions in SMS records for unusual activity.

    Timeline user activity against geographical location data derived from call logs, SMS content, and WiFi network connections.

    If available, correlate device location data (GPS, cell tower triangulation) with communication and activity timelines.

Conclusion:

The preliminary analysis reveals patterns of communication, financial transactions, and potential travel history that warrant further investigation. The identified areas of interest may provide crucial information relevant to a specific investigative objective (not defined in the provided data).
